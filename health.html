        <h2>Health Information</h2>
        <p>Maintaining good health is essential for a fulfilling life. Here are some key areas to focus on:</p>
        
        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>A balanced diet is crucial for physical and mental well-being. It includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods.</p>
        
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Regular physical activity helps to control weight, reduce health risks, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve mental health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.</p>
        
        <h3>Mental Health</h3>
        <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Practice mindfulness, seek support when needed, and make time for relaxation to manage stress and anxiety effectively.</p>
        
        <h3>Preventive Health Checkups</h3>
        <p>Regular checkups can help detect health issues early. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine the frequency of checkups based on your age and health history.</p>
